`PyCondor
<https://github.com/jrbourbeau/pycondor/>`_ (Python HTCondor) is a tool that helps build and submit HTCondor jobs in a straight-forward manner with minimal hassle.

With just a couple lines of code, you can get PyCondor up and running!

.. code-block:: python

    import pycondor

    job = pycondor.Job('examplejob', '/path/to/my_script.py')
    job.build_submit()
